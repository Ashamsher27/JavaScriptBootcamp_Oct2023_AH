    <p>1. Explain the difference between let, var, and const.</p>
    <p>Var: 
        -Var is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible as long as it's in the function. 
        -Var can be declared, at the top but can be initialized later. 
        Ex: 
        Function varExample () {
            var x; //Here, the var is declared. 
            console.lof(x); //this would be undefined even though it's been hoisted 
            
        } 
    </p>
